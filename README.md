# Pi Display Unit for Assetto Corsa

The PDU1800 ist the *PI Display Unit 1800* for [Assetto Corsa](http://www.assettocorsa.net/), a tremendous Race Simulation from [Kunos](http://www.kunos-simulazioni.com/). It acts as a dashboard and displays the current gear, speed etc etc on the [Watterott RPi Touch-Display](https://github.com/watterott/RPi-Display).

Current state: The Ingame Plugin pdu1800_data_provider sends the data to the Pi and and the code here displays it. As soon as I have time, I will provide more information including pictures.

The Information how to install can be found in the wiki
